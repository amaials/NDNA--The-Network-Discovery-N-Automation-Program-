A note about NDNA security:
----------------------


To keep the VM secure, be sure to follow all these recommendations:

1. Don't change the VM from NAT to Bridged. Keep using NAT so the guest VM is not reachable directly, except from inside the Host Machine that runs the VM.

2. Change the root password of the NDNA VM right away using passwd (default root password is dcdp)

3. Don't change the MySQL root password. This is "dcdp" too, and coded into the application in many different shell and python scripts.

4. iptables-persistent is installed and enabled on the Debian Linux VM, only allowing port 80/443, and port 22

5. Even with ssh and http/https allowed through iptables to the Linux VM, you can not access it from anywhere on the network, 
You can only access it logged into the Host machine (Windows machine for example) that's running the VM.. This is as long as you don't 
enable these ports on the VM's host machine, don't enable bridging on the NIC (stay with NAT) and are running Windows firewall or equivalent on a MAC.

6. SAMBA is not running on the Linux VM, nor is NFS.

7. Do not recommend running an email client on the host machine used to run the VM. 

8. If all above is followed, this makes it very secure. The the only way for someone to get into the Linux box is through two layers of security.
